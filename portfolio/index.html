        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Swaraj Sandip Mahangare, a B.Tech engineering student at MIT Academy of Engineering (MITAOE) with a strong focus on becoming an IoT project developer. My academic background and hands-on projects have fueled my passion for the Internet of Things (IoT), where I aim to create innovative solutions that bridge the gap between hardware and software.

            At MITAOE, I am deepening my understanding of embedded systems and IoT technologies, applying my knowledge to develop projects that leverage connectivity and automation. My goal is to design and implement smart, efficient systems that enhance everyday life and solve real-world problems.
            
            In addition to my studies, I am enthusiastic about staying current with the latest trends and advancements in IoT. I enjoy exploring new technologies and experimenting with different approaches to project development.
            
            When I'm not working on IoT projects or studying, you can find me exploring the outdoors or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I am committed to continuous learning and look forward to contributing to groundbreaking IoT solutions.</p>

            <h3>Project 1 (IOT Smart Parking Using RFID.)</h3>
            <p>

                The IoT Smart Parking System using RFID integrates RFID technology and IoT to streamline parking management. RFID tags are attached to vehicles and detected by RFID readers installed at parking entry and exit points. This system provides real-time data on parking space availability, allowing users to quickly find and reserve spots through a mobile app or web interface. By automating space tracking and updating availability in real-time, this solution reduces the time spent searching for parking and enhances overall efficiency in parking facilities.

            <h3>Project 2 (The IoT Weather Reporting System')</h3>
            <p>
         
                The IoT Weather Reporting System uses sensors to track weather conditions like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. These sensors send the collected data to a central server or cloud platform through communication modules. Users can access real-time weather information via a mobile app or website, making it easy to stay updated on current weather conditions. This system helps provide accurate weather reports and can be used for various applications such as agriculture, event planning, and outdoor activities.</p>
